---------- NOTE 1*
-- If is true, when opening the backpack, it will generate a serial number, 
-- so if you give the same backpack to someone else, that person will be able to see the items. 
-- If it has false, it will always be visible only to the player himself.
-- If you are using with ID , you need to put the backpack's on shops because the ID only generate when someone buy with shop.

---------- NOTE 2*
-- If is true, a backpack will be added to the character.
